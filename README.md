# Pysteroids

Pysteroids is my second [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) guided project.
The goal is to build an Asteroids game with Python using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) packet manager on a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
